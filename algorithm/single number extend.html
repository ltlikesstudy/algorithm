/*
We need a array x[i] with size k for saving the bits appears i times. For every input number a, generate the new counter by x[j] = (x[j-1] & a) | (x[j] & ~a). Except x[0] = (x[k] & a) | (x[0] & ~a).
In the equation, the first part indicates the the carries from previous one. The second part indicates the bits not carried to next one.
Then the algorithms run in O(kn) and the extra space O(k).
